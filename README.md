# pedigree_abundance
This repository contains a guide ("walkthrough.pdf") for conducting the analyses associated with our paper on estimating abundance in North Atlantic right whales using pedigree information. Included is also all of the code and data needed to conduct these analyses. Results are also included, in case you don't want to go through conducting each of the analyses yourself.
